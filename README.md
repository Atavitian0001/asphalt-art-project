# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project is a little bit different from what other people did. Even though from looks, it looks very simple, it means a lot to me. I painted an Armenian flag to represent my culture, who I am, where I am from, and what we have lost in the past centuries. My culture has slowly been dying over time, so I wanted to show off what we are made of. We have amazing food, dancing, and a very beautiful country.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Even though this question only asks for 2 things, I am proud of way more. I am firstly proud of finishing the project in general, since most of the time I struggle with big coding projects. Second, I am proud of drawing the armenian flag. I managed to draw on the bigger grid, and even managed to put 3 different colors on the grid.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - If I had something to improve or do differently if I had an opportunity to change it, I would of probably put more details on my flag, or drew something else that was also armenian related, but it wold be more designed and representative.
